		<p>Anthony de Mello is an Indian Jesuit priest who is known for his spiritual teachings. This book is an amalgamation of his thoughts and ideas which stem from Ignatian Spirituality. I’ll go over a few of his profound claims and my take on them:
</p>
	<p>	We are familiar with self - the beginning of energy and the birthplace of perspective; the burgeoning self is often the culprit in all disagreeable situations we find ourselves in. It is not easily recognized that this is the place where we can find joy and evoke an uninterrupted state of happiness. A big portion of time de Mello talks about attachments and what it means to release those, which are one of the ‘layers of fat’ that prevent us from accessing happiness (which he says already exists for all of us) and living an unobstructed life. Other layers of fat include religion, culture, teachings, and upbringing. The idea of detachment is a crucial one in Ignatian Spirituality. Detachment means to remove emotional dependence from any person in life to minimize negative feelings in the time when we may lose them or move on from them. We are meant to enjoy people as they are and not for what they offer us. Here, he speaks of love (in addition to the romantic sense) as being something that is outside of the shallow attachments we form for those who we love because we are attached so grimly often times. He defines love to be a liberating feeling and to say we are in love is to be in love with all, excluding no one.
</p>
	<p>	He defines a heuristic process of shedding attachments and the like in order to emulate a childlike view of life. Children are devoid and almost incapable of any prejudice, which is the product of experiences and teachings through life which tint our perspective of a person, subject, or idea. A lot of time should be spent questioning the automated feelings that arise when we approach a certain type of person or are met with a controversial idea. This is one of my favorite parts of the book in that it paralleled a journey I have put myself on in order to question any prejudice that I hold.
</p>
<p>
		He emphasizes the importance of seeing life as dynamic and that a person at a moment is an instance of that person and not a moment that should yield us to create a label for them based on their behavior in this static state. In this way, we are enjoying people for who they are and for their unlikable features, we dig deep in ourselves to find peace with it as we are the cause of finding someone else insufferable. He holds that all humans and experiences are dynamic and it is worthless to live in any other time frame other than the present because we are wholly unaware of what another time frame will offer.
</p>
<p>
		I do think this ideal way to live that he has prescribed is not one many would achieve verbatim and the detachment he speaks of so fondly of is hard to comprehend. At some points, I felt absolutely gutted with some realities that he does surface - including loss and visualizing detachment from those who I consider to be my lifeline. The higher self is only achieved through full, unfettered awareness and as advocated by de Mello, all we can do is to be kind to ourselves even if struggling to find this place of serenity eludes us now.
