      <p>  Matt Mochary is well-known in the Valley for his work in coaching CEOs in all aspects of running and building a successful tech company. Some of his prominent clients include the CEOs of Grammarly, Coinbase, Opendoor, and more recently, Alex McCaw - who contributes to sections of this book from his experience running Clearbit. I picked up this guide as someone who works on a small enough team and someone who expects to be a founder in the future. For a current founder, you are definitely overlooking several processes of the business, or at least when you have just started and are in the initial stages with few to no hires. On the other hand, if you are working on a small team or managing one, this comes with having to wear multiple hats and being met with a sizable amount of obstacles which are often not the case with larger teams, with more specified individual functions. 
        </p>
    
        <p> Overall, Mochary does an excellent job of doing away with unnecessary details - he gives out concrete and actionable advice on processes such as communication, setting OKRs, fundraising, structuring meetings, and how to effectively scale each of these. I do think the stronger points he brought up are quite critical - such as methods to settle any disagreements and how to make clear executive decisions (things which might seem to be easy to navigate, but actually, are more difficult). As someone who is building right now or is starting the process, this is definitely a toolkit item as it really points one to useful resources even outside of the book itself. Also, to those who are thinking of starting something one day, this is an excellent way to start thinking and creating efficiency with yourself and later with your future company.

        <p>I’d like to expand briefly on the compensation section, 
            which may appear to be a rather small piece of the puzzle, but is an important one as 
            human capital is your biggest spend. Compensation, for a private company, is not just an output of a 
            formula with inputs from what large, public corporations offer their employees. In the private space, 
            compensation is more convoluted because equity is an important player; it could be the case that a key 
            hire would like a bigger chunk of equity while taking a cash cut, and in this case the formula from 
            looking first at a public company isn’t too fitting. Of course, initial offers are never the endpoint 
            of the compensation conversation, but it helps to understand how pay is working in the rest of the market 
            because your cash is limited and implementing decisions partially on data for most processes is an 
            important one. It is also important to look at the private space and public space in conjunction to 
            truly get a picture of how the market is paying. <a href='https://www.advanced-hr.com/'>Here</a> is a company that helps with that. 
        </p>

        <p>Likely, there are several scenarios that you will face that are not covered here, but I do think this sets a solid foundation to be able to tackle all those moving pieces that it takes to build a sustainable business.
